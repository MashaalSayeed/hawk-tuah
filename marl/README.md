### Comparison Metrics 

- Fire Extinguished %	Percentage of total fire cells extinguished by the end of an episode.
- Response Time	Time taken to detect and start suppressing a fire after it starts.
- Average Extinguishing Time	Average time taken to extinguish a hotspot from detection.
- Total Time/Episode Length	Total time taken to extinguish all fires (or reach terminal condition).
- Energy/Battery Usage	Total energy consumed across agents (battery-based cost).
- Number of Collisions	For systems where agents can collide, track safety/efficiency.
- Idle Time	Time agents spent doing nothing (e.g., no detection, no suppression).
